# Website Deconstruction

In this project, I will learn to:

- Deconstruct a website (google, in this case)
- Rebuild given website based on a purely visible point of view, aka no functionality
- Build familiarity with using Chrome Developer Tools in an active, practical setting.

This project's goal, as stated by [TheOdinProject](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/html-css), is to get me to start thinking about how elements get placed on the page and roughly how they get styled and aligned.
